        To get the most out of your Skydio 2 and any Skydio accessories, please read all of the
        information in this guide before your first flight.
        Failure to follow these safety instructions could result in injury or damage to you, your
        Skydio product, or other persons or property.
        Additionally, not following these safety instructions could result in damaging your Skydio
        product in a way that renders it ineligible for warranty coverage.

            <b>BEFORE YOU FLY</b>
        </big>
        <br>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp; Because Skydio 2 navigates visually, it is essential to keep all of its
                cameras clean. Use the included cleaning cloth (or any clean microfiber cloth) to
                ensure cameras are free of dust and dirt before every flight.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio 2 uses magnets to retain the battery which may attract metallic debris
                that could compromise safe fitment of the battery. Prior to installing any battery,
                visually inspect the bottom of the Skydio 2 and top of the battery, including
                connectors, to ensure they are free of objects, debris or damage. Verify the battery
                is fully seated in the aircraft prior to takeoff. Do not fly with any batteries with
                enclosures that are cracked, gouged, dented or otherwise substantially physically
                deformed. Safely dispose of any damaged batteries.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; If using a mobile device running the Skydio 2 app, ensure any Battery Saver
                or Low Power modes are disabled. These modes may interfere with Skydio 2’s ability
                to communicate with the device and negatively impact your flight experience.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Remove the gimbal retaining clip from the front-facing camera.</li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Ensure all propellers are firmly attached and free of nicks, cracks, or other
                visible damage.
                <b>
                    <i>Never fly with damaged propellers.</i>
                </b>
            </li>
        </ul
        <br>

            <b>WHERE TO FLY</b>
        </big>
        <br>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp; You are responsible for your Skydio 2 at all times. Always follow FAA
                guidelines for UAS piloting. Check resources like knowbeforeyoufly.org or apps like
                B4UFLY for more information.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio 2 can only fly in normal daytime conditions. Since it navigates
                visually, it won’t work at night or in other low-light situations.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio 2 is not weatherproof and requires good visibility. Do not fly in any
                precipitation, including rain, fog, or snow.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio 2 should not be flown when winds or gusts are above 25 mph.</li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Do not fly in temperatures below 23° F (-5C) or above 104° F (40C).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>

        <big>
            <b>FLYING SAFE</b>
        </big>
        <br>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp; The Skydio 2 only avoids obstacles that are not in motion. Cars, boats,
                balls, animals, other drones, other people, or similar moving objects may not be
                avoided if they’re moving. You should exercise extreme caution and good judgment
                when flying with other people around. If you know that you’ll be around others in
                motion, we suggest you leave the Height Floor setting enabled to ensure Skydio 2
                maintains a safe elevation.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Keep your fingers away from the propellers anytime they’re spinning such as
                during launch, flight, and landing.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; When landing, Skydio 2 descends straight down and
                <b>does not avoid obstacles.</b>
                Ensure your landing area is flat and clear of obstacles.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Do not intentionally try to crash Skydio 2.</li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; When following a car or other vehicle, follow while off-road or on a closed
                course. Never use Skydio 2 over public roadways.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; The Skydio 2’s metal frame may become hot to the touch in high-temperature
                environments or direct sunlight, even if powered off. The metal frame may also
                become hot if powered on while on the ground for long periods of time.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio 2 can’t see certain visually challenging obstacles. Do not fly around
                thin branches, telephone or power lines, ropes, netting, wires, chain link fencing
                or other objects less than ½ inch in diameter.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Do not fly around transparent surfaces like windows or reflective surfaces
                like mirrors greater than 60cm wide.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; If your Skydio 2 does hit an obstacle it can’t see, it will do its best to
                stabilize itself and continue the flight.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; When the sun is low on the horizon, it can temporarily blind Skydio 2’s
                cameras depending on the angle of flight. Your drone may be cautious or jerky when
                flying directly toward the sun.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Your Skydio 2 can fly up to 36 mph under most conditions.</li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; If your Skydio 2 can’t see you, it may stop following you temporarily. It
                will wait until it reacquires you visually or use your Beacon’s GPS to find you.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio 2 may instruct you to land if it encounters an error or determines the
                environment is not safe for flying. When instructed to do so, immediately fly Skydio
                2 to the safest area nearby and land.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Flying at high altitudes may significantly increase the time required to
                return and safely land the Skydio 2. The pilot is responsible for managing the
                vehicle’s altitude, range and battery level at all times.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Be sure to watch the flight tutorials in the app and pay attention to any
                in-app messages.
