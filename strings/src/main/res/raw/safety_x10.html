Use the included microfiber cleaning cloth (or a similar type of microfiber cloth) to ensure cameras are free of dust and dirt before every flight.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Ensure all propellers are firmly attached and free of nicks, cracks, or other visible damage. Never fly with damaged propellers.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Keep your fingers away from spinning propellers at all times.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span>Ensure all 4 arms are fully deployed prior to initiating flight. Failure to do so may result in unstable flight and/or a loss of control.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Skydio X10 uses magnets to retain the battery which may attract metallic debris that could compromise the safe connection of the battery to the drone. </span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_a46ca11173aw-1 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Prior to installing any battery, visually inspect the back of the Skydio X10 around the battery connector and the front of the mating surface on the Skydio X10 battery as well as the connector itself, to ensure they are free of objects, debris, or damage. Verify the battery is fully seated in the aircraft prior to launching. </span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_a46ca11173aw-0"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Do not fly with any batteries with enclosures that are cracked, gouged, dented, or otherwise substantially physically deformed. </span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Safely handle and dispose of any batteries in accordance with all local laws and regulations. Batteries should not be stored in extreme environmental conditions.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Ensure the Skydio X10 Controller has adequate battery life remaining to complete your intended flight.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Ensure you have set your Return and Lost Connection behaviors before flying. </span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Inspect the chassis and entire drone for damage and debris prior to flight.</span></li></ul>

Before flying over bodies of water, ensure your drone has a strong GPS signal. Fly at least 10 ft (3 m) above the surface of the water.</span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_46rzttg3gik-1 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Failure to acquire strong GPS prior to flight over water may result in erratic flight and/or emergency landing and total loss of the drone</span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_46rzttg3gik-0"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Launch and land over dry surfaces. Do not launch or land from moving vessels. </span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span>Skydio X10 requires good visibility to retain its obstacle avoidance capabilities. </span><span>Obstacle avoidance is off during GPS Flight mode and can also be impaired when in low light and poor visibility. Fly with extreme caution and care under these conditions. </span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Skydio does not recommend flying the X10 under the following conditions which can result in serious injury and/or damage including total loss of the drone:</span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_46rzttg3gik-1 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span>Winds or gusts above </span><span>28.6 mph (43 km/h)</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span>Temperatures less than </span><span>-4&deg;F (-20&deg;C) or more than </span><span>113&deg;F (45&deg;C)</span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_46rzttg3gik-0"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span>When flying in temperatures below 32&deg;F (0&deg;C), we recommend pre-warming your batteries </span><span>to 50&deg;F (10&deg;C) in a room-temperature natural environment prior to launch. Endurance may be degraded when operating near temperature limits below </span><span>-4&deg;F (-20&deg;C) and above 113&deg;F (45&deg;C)</span><span>.</span></li></ul>

You should exercise extreme caution, care and good judgment when flying with other people around.</span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_a46ca11173aw-0"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">If your Skydio X10 does hit an obstacle it can&rsquo;t see, it will do its best to stabilize itself and continue the flight.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Keep your fingers away from the propellers anytime they are spinning such as during launch, flight, and landing.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span>Skydio X10 can&rsquo;t see certain visually challenging obstacles. Do not fly around thin branches, telephone or power lines, ropes, netting, wires, chain link fencing, or other objects less than &frac12; inch (1.3 centimeters) in diameter.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>This type of crash is not covered under the Skydio Limited Warranty. </span><sup>[a]</sup></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Do not intentionally try to crash Skydio X10.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Never use Skydio X10 over public roadways. When following a car or other vehicle, follow while off-road or on a closed course.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The frame of Skydio X10 may become hot to the touch in high-temperature environments or direct sunlight, even if powered off. The metal frame may also become hot if powered on while on the ground for long periods of time. Handle with extreme caution and care.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span>Do not fly over bodies of water if Skydio X10 indicates a GPS quality warning.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Exercise extreme caution and care when the sun is low on the horizon as it can temporarily blind the Skydio X10 cameras depending on the angle of flight. Your drone may be cautious or jerky when flying directly toward the sun.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Skydio X10 may send you instructions via in-app messages to land if it encounters an error or determines the environment is not safe for flying. Exercise extreme caution and immediately fly Skydio X10 to the safest area nearby and land when receiving such instructions.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Flying at high altitudes may significantly increase the time required to return and safely land the Skydio X10. The pilot is solely responsible for managing altitude, range, and battery level at all times.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Be sure to read/watch all flight tutorials and safety-related materials and pay close attention to any in-app messages.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span>Keep your hands on the controller joysticks to maintain control throughout flight.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">When you are ready to end your flight and land your drone, first stop any subject tracking or end your planned waypoint mission, and then manually fly the drone to a safe landing spot that is flat, clear of debris, and not overhead of any people or moving objects (e.g., animals). Try to avoid areas with lots of fine pebbles, sand, rocks, or similar materials.</span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_a46ca11173aw-1 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">While Skydio X10 is landing you may nudge the drone forward, backward, left, or right using the Skydio X10 Controller joysticks.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Always monitor Skydio X10 during landing and be prepared to use the &ldquo;nudge&rdquo; feature or cancel the landing if Skydio X10 is landing in an undesirable location. Use extreme caution and care when landing on elevated platforms, such as the roof of a car or truck, as the Skydio X10 may move laterally to avoid the platform before descending to the 10 ft (3 m) threshold.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c9">WARNING:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Do not attempt to hand catch Skydio X10 before obstacle avoidance is disabled automatically during landing. Attempting to hand catch Skydio X10 while obstacle avoidance is still active will cause it to attempt to avoid your hand and may result in Skydio X10 impacting yourself or another nearby object resulting in serious injury or damage.</span></li></ul>
