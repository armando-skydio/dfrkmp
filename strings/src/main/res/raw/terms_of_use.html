    <p class="type-subtitle">LAST UPDATED: December 19, 2017</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="type-h3">1. OVERVIEW</h3>
    <br>
    <p>These Terms of Use, together with the Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions of Sale and
        Limited
        Warranty Statement, (collectively the “Terms”) govern your use of the Skydio, Inc.,
        (“Skydio,” “we,” or “us”) website Skydio.com and any subdomains thereof (the “Website”),
        your Skydio product and accessories (“Product”), including the software in the product
        (“Product Software”), and any software applications that can be downloaded via your device
        (“Mobile Apps”) (collectively the “Offerings”). By using the Offerings, you are consenting
        to the Terms. The term “you” or “your” as used in the Terms means any person or entity who
        accesses the Website, creates an Account or utilizes the Products, including Owners and
        Authorized Users as defined below. In the event of a conflict between the Terms, these Terms
        of Use will control.
    </p>
    <p>As described below, the Offerings may incorporate certain features allowing for software and
        other Updates to be implemented in the future. To the extent such Updates are added to or
        enabled for the Products, including automatic software Updates, they will automatically
        become part of the Offerings and will be subject to the Terms.
    </p>
    <p>We may periodically modify the Terms. If we make significant changes to the Terms we will
        notify you via the Offerings (e.g., by providing notice via our Mobile Apps or email)
        indicating that the Terms have been changed. By continuing to use the Offerings you are
        consenting to the revised Terms. If you do not agree with the modifications, you must cease
        using the Offerings.
    </p>
    <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT
        REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IN CERTAIN
        CIRCUMSTANCES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS. VIEW THESE TERMS HERE.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="type-h3">2. ELIGIBILITY AND ACCOUNTS</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The Products and Offerings are intended solely for users who own a Skydio Product or are
        Authorized Users of a Skydio Product and are not intended for resale. Any registration, use
        of the Products or access to the Offerings by anyone who is not so permitted is strictly
        prohibited and in violation of the Terms. By using the Products and Offerings, you represent
        to us that you are legally permitted to use the Product.
    </p>
    <p>To use the Products and certain portions of the Offerings, you may be required to register
        and use a Skydio Account (“Account”) or be an Authorized User (see below) of the Account. If
        you are under the age of 18, you must have your parent or guardian create an account for
        you. By creating an Account, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older
        and are legally competent to enter into and agree to the Terms. If you are creating an
        Account for your child or custodial charge (“Minor”) you represent and warrant that such
        Minor is legally permitted to operate the Product, that you and such Minor understands these
        Terms and that you agree to ensure your Minor’s compliance with them. You agree that you are
        liable for any violations of the Terms by such Minor.
    </p>
    <p>To create an Account, you will register your email address or phone number and confirm it by
        entering a code you receive. You must provide us with accurate, complete and updated
        registration information about yourself and the Minor for which you are creating an Account
        (if applicable). You may not use an email address or phone number that you do not have the
        right to use, or another person’s identity with the intent to impersonate that person. The
        individual who creates the Skydio Account is the “Owner.” If an Owner discloses their log-in
        credentials to another person or otherwise allows another person to access the Account, that
        individual is authorized by the Owner to utilize the Product and Offerings under that
        Owner’s Account. Such individual is an “Authorized User.” You (as the Owner of the Account)
        (i) will inform each Authorized User of the Terms, and (ii) represent and warrant that each
        such Authorized User understands the Terms and that you agree to ensure each such Authorized
        User’s compliance with the Terms. You (as the Owner of an Account) are responsible for all
        actions taken by Minors and Authorized Users and any other third parties related to your
        Account, including any violations of the Terms by such Minors, Authorized Users and third
        parties.
    </p>
    <p>Accordingly, you must protect the security of your Account and only share these credentials
        with individuals that you trust to have such access.
    </p>

            you the purchase price, if any, of the Mobile App;
        </li>
        <li>You acknowledge and agree that Skydio, and not the App Provider, is responsible for

            intellectual property rights, Skydio, and not the App Provider, will be responsible for
            the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim to

            the App Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to
            enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.

        usable by a competitive product or service. You and your Authorized Users may not link to
        the Website or any portion of the Offerings (including linking to a specific portion of the
        Offerings or framing Content in any way) and you and your Authorized Users may not employ
        script searches or search results from the Website in a manner that results in the display

        Apps or the proper operation and usage of the Offerings by any other users or third parties.

        DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
        WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE
        DEBTOR.” YOU AND YOUR AUTHORIZED USERS HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN ANY OTHER
        JURISDICTION. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SKYDIO ALSO LIMITS THE
        DURATION OF ANY APPLICABLE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS TO THE DURATION SPECIFIED IN THE
        LIMITED WARRANTY STATEMENT. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED
        WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>e. Limitation of Liability.</strong>
        IN NO EVENT SHALL SKYDIO OR ANY OF ITS LICENSORS OR INFORMATION PROVIDERS AND OTHER
        SUPPLIERS AND THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, AFFILIATES AND AGENTS
        (COLLECTIVELY, “SKYDIO PARTIES”) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY USER FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE,
        INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, USE, OR DATA,
        IN EACH CASE ARISING UNDER ANY THEORY, INCLUDING UNDER WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
        NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHER THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH SKYDIO PARTY IS AWARE OF OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
        THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
        incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
        you.
    </p>
    <p>THE SKYDIO PARTIES’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU IS
        LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, YOU PAID TO US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO
        THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY OR (B) $100.
    </p>
    <p>The foregoing limitations apply, even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
    <p>Please refer to the limited warranty statement for details on the warranty and limitation of
        liability for the product.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>f. Indemnification.</strong>You agree to defend and indemnify the Skydio Parties
        from any claim or demand, including any and all losses, liabilities, claims, demands,
        damages, costs or expenses, causes of action, suits, proceedings, judgments, and awards,
        including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, whether brought by third parties or
        otherwise, due to or arising out of your or your Authorized Users’ breach of the Terms and
        any use of the Offerings other than as expressly permitted in the Terms. The foregoing
        indemnity obligations will survive any termination of the Terms or your or your Authorized
        Users’ use of the Offerings. Skydio may, at its own expense, assume the exclusive defense
        and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, which will not excuse your
        indemnity obligations under this section. You agree not to settle any matter subject to the
        foregoing indemnification obligations without the express consent and approval of Skydio.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>g. Termination and Suspension.</strong>
        We may terminate the Terms, or terminate, suspend or restrict your and your Authorized
        Users’ access to the Offerings if you or your Authorized Users violate any of the Terms.
        Upon termination or suspension, your and your Authorized Users’ right to access the Website
        and use the Offerings will immediately cease. We may discontinue, temporarily or
        permanently, all or part of the Offerings with or without notice. If you or your Authorized
        Users’ access to the Offerings is suspended or terminated by us, you and they agree that you
        and they will not attempt to access the Offerings by any alias or other disguised or
        fraudulent identity or otherwise without our express prior written approval.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>h. Violations and Complaints.</strong>Without limiting Skydio’s rights or remedies
        under the Terms or at law or in equity, Skydio may investigate complaints related to your
        use of the Offerings and alleged violations of these Terms and take any action we deem
        necessary and appropriate in connection with such complaints and violations. Such action may
        include reporting any suspected activity that is in violation of these Terms or in violation
        of any law to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties. In addition, we
        may disclose any information necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities, including
        personal information, relating to such complaints and violations. You and your Authorized
        Users agree that monetary damages may not provide a sufficient remedy to us for violations
        of the Terms and you and they consent to injunctive or other equitable relief for such
        violations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>i. General.</strong>You may not assign the Terms or otherwise transfer or sublicense
        any rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part; any attempt to do so shall be
        void. We may transfer, assign, or delegate the Terms and our rights and obligations without
        consent. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the
        Terms to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be superseded by a valid,
        enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the
        remainder of the Terms will continue in effect and remain fully enforceable. Skydio shall
        not be liable to you for a failure or delay in its performance of any of its obligations
        under the Terms to the extent that such failure or delay is caused by events such as fire,
        riot, flood, labor disputes, natural disaster, regulatory action, internet or
        telecommunications failures, terrorist acts, or other causes beyond Skydio’s reasonable
        control. Except as expressly stated herein, the Terms constitute the entire agreement
        between you and Skydio with respect to the Offerings, and the Terms supersede and replace
        all prior or contemporaneous communications, proposals, understandings or agreements,
        whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Skydio with respect to the Offerings or
        the subject matter of these Terms. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms will be
        effective only if in writing and signed by you and Skydio. Our failure to enforce our rights
        and remedies available to us with respect your breach of these Terms shall not constitute a
        waiver of such breach nor of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any
        other provision of these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>j. Governing Law and Arbitration; No Class Actions.</strong>These Terms, and any
        claim, cause of action or dispute (“claim”) arising out of or related to these Terms shall
        be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California regardless of your
        country of origin or where you access the Offerings. ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY
        WAY TO THESE TERMS OR THE OFFERINGS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN
        COURT, except for Skydio’s right to seek injunctive relief as set forth below.
    </p>
    <p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Skydio and you are an individual, you may opt
        out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to help@skydio.com within 30 days of
        the day you first access or use the Offerings.
    </p>
    <p>If you intend to seek arbitration, you must first send written notice to Skydio’s Customer
        Service Center of your intent to arbitrate ("Notice”). The Notice to Skydio should be sent
        by any of the following means: (i) electronic mail to help@skydio.com; or (ii) sending the
        Notice by U.S. Postal Service certified mail to Skydio Inc., Attention: Legal, 114 Hazel
        Ave, Redwood City, CA 94061. The Notice must (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim
        or dispute; and (y) set forth the specific relief sought; and (z) set forth your name,
        address and contact information. If we intend to seek arbitration against you, we will send
        any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.
    </p>
    <p>The arbitration will be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be
        final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings will be governed by the Arbitration Rules
        and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect,
        as modified by the Terms. The JAM's rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling
        1-800-352-5267. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this
        arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by these Terms. The arbitration will be
        conducted in San Francisco, California, using the English language. Judgment on the award
        rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. For any
        claim where the potential award is reasonably likely to be $10,000 or less, either you or
        Skydio may elect to have the dispute resolved through non-appearance-based arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, YOU AND SKYDIO EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE
        RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS,
        CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather
        than in arbitration, YOU AND SKYDIO EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. If a court of
        competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable,
        you and Skydio agree that all claims arising out of or related to these Terms must be
        resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located San Mateo County, California, and
        you and Skydio each agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts
        for the purpose of litigating all such claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you
        agree that Skydio shall still be allowed to apply for and obtain injunctive remedies (or an
        equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    </p>
