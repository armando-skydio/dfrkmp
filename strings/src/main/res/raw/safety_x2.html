            <b>BEST PRACTICES</b>
        </big>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp; Make sure to read the user manual and quick start guides before flying.</li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Keep your fingers away from moving propellers at all times.</li>

            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Clean all of the cameras before each flight so Skydio X2 can see clearly.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Regularly charge your drone and controller to avoid flying with low
                battery.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Follow FAA guidelines and local and federal laws when using your Skydio X2.

            <b>FLYING WITH THE OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM</b>
        </big>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio X2 can’t see certain visually challenging obstacles.
                <b>DO NOT</b>
                fly around thin objects including but not limited to thin branches, telephone or
                power lines, ropes, netting, wires, chain link fencing, or other objects less than
                1/2 inch in diameter. ALWAYS fly with extreme caution in environments where thin
                objects are present.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio X2 only avoids obstacles that are not in motion. Cars, boats, animals,
                other aircraft/UAS, people, or similar moving objects will not be avoided if they’re
                moving. You should exercise extreme caution and good judgment when flying with other
                people around.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio X2’s obstacle avoidance system is off during low light, poor
                visibility, and night time operations. Fly with extreme caution under these
                conditions.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; If your Skydio X2 does hit an obstacle it can’t see, it will do its best to
                stabilize itself and continue the flight.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <b>BEFORE YOU FLY</b>
        </big>
        <br>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp; Be sure to read/watch all flight tutorials and safety-related materials
                including the user manual.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Because Skydio X2 navigates visually, it is essential to keep all of its
                cameras clean. Use the included cleaning cloth (or any clean microfiber cloth) to
                ensure cameras are free of dust and dirt before every flight.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Ensure all 4 arms are fully deployed against the hard stops and levers are
                fully seated against the arms prior [image of lever + alignment visual indicators]
                to initiating flight. Failure to do so may result in unstable flight and/or a loss
                of control. Additionally, a moderate amount of force should be required to fully
                seat the lever to the arm - if the lever can be closed with low effort, damage has
                occurred within the hinge and the drone should not be flown.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio X2 uses magnets to retain the battery which may attract metallic
                debris that could compromise the safe fitment of the battery. Prior to installing
                any battery, visually inspect the back of the Skydio X2 around the battery connector
                and the front of the mating surface on the Skydio X2 battery as well as the
                connector itself, to ensure they are free of objects, debris or damage. Verify the
                battery is fully seated in the aircraft prior to takeoff. Do not fly with any
                batteries with enclosures that are cracked, gouged, dented or otherwise
                substantially physically deformed. Safely dispose of any damaged batteries.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Ensure the Skydio Enterprise Controller has adequate battery life remaining
                to complete your intended flight.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Ensure all propellers are firmly attached and free of nicks, cracks, or other
                visible damage. Never fly with damaged propellers.
            </li>

            <b>WHERE TO FLY</b>
        </big>
        <br>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp; You are solely responsible for your Skydio X2 at all times. Always follow FAA
                guidelines for UAS piloting. Check resources like knowbeforeyoufly.org or apps like
                B4UFLY for more information. Do not fly in an environment where the use of the
                device is not authorized or restricted.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio X2 is not waterproof and requires good visibility to enable obstacle
                avoidance. Do not fly in any precipitation, including rain, fog, snow, or similar
                conditions.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Skydio X2 should not be flown when winds or gusts are above 20 knots (23
                MPH).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&nbsp; Do not fly your drone in temperatures less than 14F (-10C) or above 109F
                (43C). When flying in temperatures below 32F (0C), ensure your batteries are
                pre-warmed to 50F (10C) prior to takeoff. Endurance may be degraded when operating
                near temperature limits.

            <b>FLYING SAFELY</b>
        </big>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>&nbsp; Be sure to read/watch all flight tutorials and safety-related materials and pay
            attention to any in-app messages.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>&nbsp; Keep your fingers away from the propellers anytime they’re spinning such as
            during launch, flight, and landing.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>&nbsp; Ensure your landing area is flat and clear of obstacles. See the Skydio X2 User
            Guide for more details on landing behavior.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>&nbsp; Do not intentionally try to crash Skydio X2.</li>
        <br>
        <li>&nbsp; Never use Skydio X2 over public roadways. When following a car or other vehicle,
            follow while off-road or on a closed course.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>&nbsp; The Skydio X2’s metal frame may become hot to the touch in high-temperature
            environments or direct sunlight, even if powered off. The metal frame may also become
            hot if powered on while on the ground for long periods of time.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>&nbsp; We do not recommend flying over bodies of water.</li>
        <br>
        <li>&nbsp; Do not fly around transparent surfaces like windows or reflective surfaces like
            mirrors greater than 60cm wide.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>&nbsp; Exercise caution when the sun is low on the horizon, it can temporarily blind
            Skydio X2’s cameras depending on the angle of flight. Your drone may be cautious or
            jerky when flying directly toward the sun.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>&nbsp; Skydio X2 may instruct you to land if it encounters an error or determines the
            environment is not safe for flying. When instructed to do so, immediately fly Skydio X2
            to the safest area nearby and land.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>&nbsp; Flying at high altitudes may significantly increase the time required to return
            and safely land the Skydio X2. The pilot is responsible for managing the vehicle’s
            altitude, range and battery level at all times.

            <b>LANDING SAFELY</b>
        </big>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp; When you are ready to end your flight and land your drone, first stop any
                subject tracking or end your planned waypoint mission, and then manually fly the
                drone to a safe landing spot that is flat, clear of debris, and not overhead of any
                people or animals. Try to avoid areas with lots of fine pebbles, sand, rocks, or
                similar materials.
            </li>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>&nbsp; While Skydio X2 is landing you may nudge the drone forwards, backward,
                    left, or right using the Enterprise Controller or digital thumbsticks in the
                    app. See the X2 User Guide for more detail.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>&nbsp; Always monitor Skydio X2 during landing and be prepared to use the
                    “nudge” feature or cancel the landing if Skydio X2 is landing in an undesirable
                    location. Use particular caution when landing on elevated platforms, such as the
                    roof of a car or truck, as the Skydio X2 may move laterally to avoid the
                    platform before descending to the 3m threshold.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>&nbsp; When landing and the Skydio X2 LEDs are blue, obstacle avoidance is on.
                    When LEDs are yellow, obstacle avoidance is off. When the Skydio X2 LEDs are
                    blue, the vehicle may not descend in a vertical line and may deviate to avoid
                    obstacles.
                </li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <li>&nbsp; <b>WARNING</b>: We highly recommend that users do not attempt hand launching
                or landing (catching) their first few flights with Skydio X2 until they’ve become
                familiar with the product. Do not attempt to hand catch Skydio X2 unless the X2 is
                landing and the LEDs have turned yellow. Attempting to hand catch Skydio X2 while
                obstacle avoidance is active will cause it to attempt to avoid your hand and may
                result in Skydio X2 impacting yourself or another nearby object which could cause
                severe bodily harm or injury or damage to the product. Prior to attempting to hand
                launch / land, please also refer to the additional information found here:
